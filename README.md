## How It Works

Kosha is built with Python and leverages several powerful libraries:

-   **[python-telegram-bot](https://python-telegram-bot.org/):** For interacting with the Telegram Bot API.
-   **[Google Gemini API](https://ai.google.dev/):** For all AI-powered features, including summaries and chat.
-   **[APScheduler](https://apscheduler.readthedocs.io/):** For scheduling reminders, daily summaries, and check-ins.
-   **[Dateparser](https://dateparser.readthedocs.io/):** For parsing natural language dates and times.
-   **SQLite:** For all data storage.

## Getting Started

To run your own instance of Kosha, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

-   Python 3.9+
-   A Telegram Bot Token (get one from [BotFather](https://t.me/botfather))
-   A Google Gemini API Key (get one from [Google AI Studio](https://ai.google.dev/))

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/sairaghavendragan/Kosha.git
    cd Kosha
    ```

2.  **Install the required packages:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3.  **Set up your environment variables:**
    -   Copy the example `.env.example` file to a new `.env` file:
        ```bash
        cp .env.example .env
        ```
    -   Open the `.env` file and add your credentials.
    -   To make the bot private, you **must** add your `MY_CHAT_ID`. To get your ID, send a message to the Telegram bot **[@raw_info_bot](https://t.me/raw_info_bot)**.
        ```
        BOT_TOKEN=YOUR_TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN
        GEMINI_API_KEY=YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY
        TIMEZONE=Your/Timezone # e.g., America/New_York
        MY_CHAT_ID=YOUR_TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID
        ```

4.  **Initialize the database:**
    The bot will automatically create the `database.db` file on its first run.

5.  **Run the bot:**
    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```

Your bot should now be running and responding only to you!
